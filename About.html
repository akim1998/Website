      Hello, my name is Andrew Kim. I am a graphic designer studying at Boston University. Working on a computer is one of the few things I enjoyed doing ever since I was a kid. With programs such as illustrator, I am able to express my passion for working on designs that would be put out for the public's viewing. Alongside this, I enjoy drawing with pen and graphite. I also enjoy playing a few games to wind down for the day, or even listening to some songs on Spotify. I don't go out much, but the inside is enough of an adventure and excitement for me, yet at the same time the outside is also a great atmosphere that refreshes my senses and helps bring focus back to my work.
